# MyPoGoCompanion — signed-off feature descriptions

How each feature works from the user's side, as signed off by the owner. Priorities are in `planning/PRIORITIES.md` (MVP / Good to have / Future); technical notes in `PLAN.md`.

## 1. Pokédex — signed off 2026-10-27

**What it's for.** Look up any Pokémon in the game and find the ones that match what you need — for example "every Ground type with Attack above 250" or "all Legendaries not released yet".

**Opening it (MVP).** A list of every Pokémon: all 1,025 species, and each version that plays differently gets its own line — Charizard, Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y and Shadow Charizard are four lines; Vulpix and Alolan Vulpix are two. Each line shows the picture, Pokédex number, name, types and a few key numbers (such as base stats and max CP; exact columns decided in design). Starts in Pokédex order. Tapping a line opens the Pokémon's page (feature 2).

**Searching (MVP).** One box that filters as you type: names in English or Portuguese ("Garchomp", "garch"), Pokédex numbers ("445"), and common nicknames ("chomp", "m2", "zard").

**Filtering (MVP).** Combinable filters: type (one or two), generation, stats (min/max Attack, Defense, Stamina, max CP), variants (Shadows, Megas, can Dynamax/Gigantamax), category (Legendary, Mythical, Ultra Beast), released in GO or not.

**Sorting (MVP).** Tap any column to sort; tap again to reverse.

**Later (Good to have).** Move filters ("can learn Earth Power", "has an Elite TM move"); availability filters ("shiny available", "in raids right now", from the AI researcher's data); "I own it" markers with shiny/lucky/hundo/Shadow badges and owned/missing filters (needs the collection); collection tracker with progress per region and category; compare 2–4 Pokémon side by side.

**Future.** Saved views (a saved filter + sort, reopened in one tap).

**Where the information comes from.** Game files (stats, forms, moves, released), downloaded and checked daily; PvPoke and our raid calculations (rankings); the game's text files (Portuguese names); the game's sprites (pictures). Nothing is entered by hand.

**Limit.** Forms that share a Pokédex number are shown separately here, but the game's search strings can't tell them apart.
